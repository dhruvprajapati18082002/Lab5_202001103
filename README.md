STATIC CODE ANALYSIS
Static code analysis is a method of computer program debugging that is done by examining the code without executing the program. The process provides an understanding of the code structure and can help ensure that the code adheres to industry standards.
PYLINT
I have chosen Pylint as the static code analysis tool. Since Spyder( Which is a Python IDE )  has Pylint integrated as a backend, I installed Spyder IDE.

In the first experiment, I chose primary_colors file from the Colors folder.
Initially we can see that there are no errors and so no errors are shown in the evaluation.

We can also analyse the warnings and convention here.<br />
2) Now we change the code so that there is an error in line 18.

 The error is also indicated in Spyder.

 Now we check the file check_colors from Colors folder.
